		<h2> All about Jellyfish </h2>
		<p> Jellyfish are aquatic creatures that have existed for millions of years in the depth of the ocean. Though the term &quot;fish&quot; appears in their name, 
		they are not fish, but rather a type of zooplankton. Jellyfish are organisms made up of 95% water and have a bell-shaped structure with tentacles. There are around 1000 
		different species of jellyfish that come in all shapes and sizes. Some jellyfish can be the size of whales, whereas others can be as small as a grain of rice. Jellyfish have no 
		bones but have a neural net that forms a nervous system. The nervous system allows them to detect other sea creatures and helps them sting these animals to prey or defend 
		themselves. The sting is venomous and  can kill a human in under 5 minutes. Jellyfish eat, absorb nutrients and produce water through their bell-shaped top. They are carnivores 
		and often prey and small fish. Unique features of jellyfish include&hellip; </p>
